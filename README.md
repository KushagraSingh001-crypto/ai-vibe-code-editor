A running MongoDB instance

Ollama installed for AI features

1. Clone the Repository

Bash
git clone https://github.com/kushagrasingh001/crypto-ai-vibe-code-editor.git
cd crypto-ai-vibe-code-editor
2. Install Dependencies

Bash
npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file named .env in the root of the project and add the following variables.

Code snippet
# MongoDB Connection String
DATABASE_URL="your_mongodb_connection_string"

# NextAuth.js Secrets (generate a secret using `openssl rand -base64 32`)
AUTH_SECRET="your_nextauth_secret"

# GitHub Auth Provider
AUTH_GITHUB_ID="your_github_oauth_client_id"
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET="your_github_oauth_client_secret"

# Google Auth Provider
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID="your_google_oauth_client_id"
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET="your_google_oauth_client_secret"

# GitHub Token (for importing repos)
# Create a personal access token with 'public_repo' scope
GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"
4. Set Up the Database

Generate the Prisma client and push the schema to your MongoDB database.

Bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
5. Set Up the AI Assistant (Ollama)

The AI features connect to a local Ollama instance.

Install and run Ollama by following the instructions on their website.

Pull the codellama:7b model, which is used by this project for chat and code completion.

Bash
ollama run codellama:7b
(Ensure Ollama is running before starting the application.)

6. Run the Development Server

Start the Next.js application.

Bash
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application running.
